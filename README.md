# dirac16complex

A 16-component complex Grassmann (fermion) spinor field of Pin(4,4) in 4+4
dimensions: its Lagrangian, covariant field equations, canonical quantization,
energy-momentum tensor and equations of state, first in an arbitrary gravitational
field, then in the primordial pair-creation field of the author's notebook, and
finally a numerical investigation of whether its pressure and energy density
behave like dark matter and/or dark energy.

## The fold of UM-3: definition and examples

<!-- begin fold definition -->
**Definition.** The *fold* is the seven-dimensional surface of the author's eight-dimensional spacetime on which the
cosine of the angle $z = 6Hx_0$ of the hidden direction vanishes:

$$
\mathcal{F} = \big\{X = (x_0, x_1, \dots, x_7):\ \cos(6Hx_0) = 0\big\},\qquad
\text{in one period } 0 < z < \pi\text{ of the metric: } z = \frac{\pi}{2},\quad x_0 = \frac{\pi}{12H} \tag{FD-1}
$$

**Symbols in (FD-1).**

- $\mathcal{F}$: The fold: the seven-dimensional surface $\cos(6Hx_0) = 0$ of the eight-dimensional spacetime (FD-1), in one period $0 < z < \pi$ the surface $z = \pi/2$, $x_0 = \pi/(12H)$, where $\sigma = 0$; $\vert_{\mathcal{F}}$ means restricted to the fold. Status: DERIVED.
- $X = \{x_0, \dots, x_7\}$: The author's coordinates of the eight-dimensional spacetime, $X = \{x_0, x_1, \dots, x_7\}$ with the hidden direction first (Dirac_Einstein-Lovelock_4+4_Nash.nb, section DEFCHART); $X^M$ is the coordinate with the index $M$ and $\mathrm{d}^8X = \mathrm{d}x_0\,\mathrm{d}x_1\cdots\mathrm{d}x_7$ the coordinate volume element. Unit: length (each coordinate). Status: AUTHOR.
- $x_0$: The hidden space-like coordinate (listed first); the metric depends on it through $z = 6Hx_0$, periodically with the period $\pi/(6H)$. Unit: length. Status: AUTHOR.
- $x_1$: The first coordinate of ordinary 3-space. Unit: length. Status: AUTHOR.
- $x_7$: The third of the three extra time-like coordinates. Unit: length. Status: AUTHOR.
- $H$: The author's constant (an inverse length) that fixes the period $\pi/(6H)$ of $x_0$, the Lovelock couplings $\alpha_{(p)} = w_{(p)}H^{2-2p}$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda = -7H^2$ (the author's original value $-10H^2$ was corrected on 2026-10-25); in UM-3 a free parameter. Unit: GeV (1/length). Status: AUTHOR.
- $z$: The angle variable of the hidden direction, $z = 6Hx_0$; one period of $x_0$ is $0 < z < \pi$, the fold is $z = \pi/2$. Unit: dimensionless. Status: AUTHOR.
- $\pi$: The number pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. Unit: dimensionless. Value: 3.141592654. Status: STANDARD.
- $\Lambda$: The eight-dimensional cosmological constant, $\Lambda = -7H^2$: with the corrected weights the value for which the static block is a vacuum (its Lovelock tensors add to $7H^2$ in every direction). The author's original value was $\Lambda = -10H^2$ (he writes the pure number $\Lambda_{\mathrm{N}} = 10$ in $0 = -\Lambda_{\mathrm{N}} + \sum_p H^{-2p}w_{(p)}\mathcal{E}_{(p)}$). Unit: GeV$^2$. Value: $-7H^2$; the author's original $-10H^2$. Status: AUTHOR (the term), DERIVED (the value).
- $w_{(p)}$: The Lovelock weights, $w_{(1)} = 1$, $w_{(2)} = 1/20$, $w_{(3)} = 1/360$: the only weights for which both coefficients of a transverse traceless gravitational wave in the static bulk vanish, $1 - 40w_{(2)} + 360w_{(3)}$ (of its second time derivative) and $1 - 24w_{(2)} + 72w_{(3)}$ (of its second derivatives along ordinary space and along $\sigma$). Then the four-dimensional graviton of the fold travels at the speed of light at linear order, and no graviton of the static bulk travels faster, because the static bulk has no linear graviton at all (the Born-Infeld point of Lovelock gravity in eight dimensions). The author's original weights $w_{(2)} = 1/32$, $w_{(3)} = 1/1152$ (Dirac_Einstein-Lovelock_4+4_Nash.nb, In[134]) made bulk gravitons $\sqrt5$ times faster than light; they were corrected at the author's order of 2026-10-25. Unit: dimensionless. Value: $(1, 1/20, 1/360)$; the author's original $(1, 1/32, 1/1152)$. Status: AUTHOR (the form), ASSUMED (the criterion of the correction), DERIVED (the unique values that meet it).
- $\Lambda_{\mathrm{N}}$: The author's pure number in the vacuum equations of his notebook, $\Lambda = -\Lambda_{\mathrm{N}}H^2$: his original value 10, corrected to 7 on 2026-10-25. Unit: dimensionless. Value: 7 (the author's original 10). Status: AUTHOR.

$X = \{x_0, \dots, x_7\}$ are the author's coordinates: $x_0$ the hidden space-like direction, $x_1, x_2, x_3$ ordinary space,
$x_4$ the time, $x_5, x_6, x_7$ the three extra times; $H$ is the author's constant (an inverse length). The author's metric
depends on $x_0$ only through $\cot^2z$ and $(\sin^2z)^{1/6}$, so it repeats with the period $\pi/(6H)$ of $x_0$, and every
period $0 < z < \pi$ contains exactly one surface of $\mathcal{F}$, at $z = \pi/2$: $\mathcal{F}$ is the union of these copies,
one per period (example 2), and "the fold" without a qualifier is the copy in the period that contains our world. A point of
the fold is labelled by the seven coordinates $x_1, \dots, x_7$, and the metric restricted to the fold ($\mathrm{d}x_0 = 0$,
$z = \pi/2$) is

It depends on $\sigma$ only through $\lvert\sigma\rvert$. The function $\mathcal{W}(\sigma) = \mathrm{e}^{-2H\lvert\sigma\rvert}$,
which multiplies the squared steps of ordinary space and of the extra times, is the warp factor of the metric (its square
root $\mathrm{e}^{-H\lvert\sigma\rvert}$ multiplies the lengths); the time $x_4$ is not warped. Four properties make the surface
$\sigma = 0$ a fold, and together they single it out within the period:

1. *It is a mirror.* The reflection $\sigma \to -\sigma$ (that is $z \to \pi - z$, or $x_0 \to \pi/(6H) - x_0$) maps the metric
   to itself, and the fold is the only surface of the period that the reflection leaves in place: the two halves of the
   period are mirror images of each other, joined along the fold, as the two halves of a folded sheet of paper are joined
   along the crease.
2. *The warp factor is largest on it.* The warp factor $(\sin^2z)^{1/6} = \mathrm{e}^{-2H\lvert\sigma\rvert}$ equals 1 on the
   fold and decreases on both sides.
3. *The metric has a kink on it.* The metric is continuous across the fold, but its first derivative along $\sigma$ jumps.
   The extrinsic curvature of the surfaces $\sigma = \text{const}$ changes sign across the fold,

$$
K^a{}_b = \frac12\,g^{ac}\,\partial_\sigma g_{cb}:\qquad
K^{1}{}_{1} = K^{2}{}_{2} = K^{3}{}_{3} = K^{5}{}_{5} = K^{6}{}_{6} = K^{7}{}_{7} = -H\,\mathrm{sgn}(\sigma),\qquad K^{4}{}_{4} = 0 \tag{FD-5}

   so the two coordinate values on either side of $x_0 = \pi/(12H)$ at the same coordinate distance lie at the same proper
   distance from the fold: the coordinate line of $x_0$ is folded onto the line of proper distances (a fold map, example 5).

**What lives on the fold.** In UM-3 the Standard Model (the Higgs doublet with the author's ad hoc vacuum, a time-dependent
choice of its vacuum value; the gauge fields of $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$; three generations of quarks and
leptons and three right-handed neutrinos) and the fold fluid (its tension and the pressure along the extra times that keeps
their volume fixed) live on the fold: they are fields at $\sigma = 0$, functions of $x_1, \dots, x_4$ (no field depends on
the extra times). Integrated over the extra times, the fold is the four-dimensional universe that we observe, with the
metric $\mathrm{diag}(\mathrm{e}^{2a_4}, \mathrm{e}^{2a_4}, \mathrm{e}^{2a_4}, -1)$ in $x_1, \dots, x_4$. dirac16complex (the
author's spinor field of eight dimensions) and gravity live in the bulk $\sigma \ne 0$ as well as on the fold; the bound
states $\chi$ of dirac16complex are the part of it that the fold holds, and the portals (couplings between dirac16complex and
Standard-Model fields) act at $\sigma = 0$. In UM-3 files "the fold" means this surface; the examples below use the word
for other surfaces with the same properties. The word is not used in its other senses: a set of equal energy levels is
called degenerate, and a growth by the factor $\mathrm{e}$ is called an e-folding.

**Examples of folds that are meaningful for UM-3.**

1. *Our fold.* The fold $z = \pi/2$ of the period that contains our world (FD-1): the seven-dimensional world-volume of the
   Standard Model, and after the integration over the extra times the four-dimensional universe that we observe.
2. *The copies of the fold.* Because the metric repeats with the period $\pi/(6H)$, every surface
   $x_0 = \pi/(12H) + (\text{an integer multiple of } \pi/(6H))$ is a copy of the fold, one per period. Neighbouring copies are
   separated by a tip ($z$ a multiple of $\pi$), where the warp factor $(\sin^2z)^{1/6}$ vanishes and $g_{x_0x_0} = \cot^2z$
   diverges, and which lies at an infinite proper distance from both: in proper distance every copy has its own complete
   line $-\infty < \sigma < \infty$. A compact direction of length $L$ would give every field a tower of particles with the
   masses $2\pi n/L$, $n = 1, 2, \dots$ (a Kaluza-Klein tower); because the copies are infinitely far apart, the period
   $\pi/(6H)$ of $x_0$ produces no such tower with the spacing $12H$, and the $x_0$ mass of the bound states is their binding
   to the fold.
3. *A folded sheet of paper.* The crease of a folded sheet is a fold in this sense: the two halves are mirror images
   (property 1) joined along the crease, the sheet is continuous there and its direction changes abruptly (property 3).
   In UM-3 the direction across the crease is the hidden direction $\sigma$, the seven directions along the crease are
   $x_1, \dots, x_7$, and the crease is the fold.
4. *A folded function.* The warp factor $\mathrm{e}^{-2H\lvert\sigma\rvert}$ is the simplest folded function: continuous,
   mirror symmetric, largest at $\sigma = 0$, with a jump of its derivative,

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\sigma}\mathrm{e}^{-2H\lvert\sigma\rvert} = -2H\,\mathrm{sgn}(\sigma)\,\mathrm{e}^{-2H\lvert\sigma\rvert},\qquad
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}\sigma^2}\mathrm{e}^{-2H\lvert\sigma\rvert} = 4H^2\,\mathrm{e}^{-2H\lvert\sigma\rvert} - 4H\,\delta_{\mathrm{D}}(\sigma) \tag{FD-7}

   whose delta function is the origin of the thin source of property 3. Every metric function of FD-4 depends on $\sigma$
   through $\lvert\sigma\rvert$ and is folded at $\sigma = 0$ in this sense.
5. *A fold map.* In the mathematics of smooth maps the fold (Whitney's fold singularity) is the map $u \mapsto u^2$ of a line
   onto a half-line: it folds the line at $u = 0$, two points $\pm u$ land on the same point, and the derivative of the map
   vanishes on the fold. Near the fold the map from the author's coordinate $x_0$ to the distance $\lvert\sigma\rvert$ from the
   fold is of this kind (FD-6), and $g_{x_0x_0} = \cot^2z$, the square of the derivative $\mathrm{d}\sigma/\mathrm{d}x_0$,
   vanishes there.

   has a fold at $y_{\mathrm{RS}} = 0$ with the properties 1 to 3 (its coordinate $y_{\mathrm{RS}}$ is already the proper
   distance, so property 4 does not arise); Einstein's equations require there a brane of the tension $\lambda_{\mathrm{RS}}$
   (Israel's junction condition) and in the bulk the vacuum energy $\Lambda_{\mathrm{RS}}$, and the bulk is otherwise empty. The
   fold of UM-3 is of the same kind: its static block is a vacuum of the bulk with a fold of pure tension (FD-12). It differs
   in that the time $x_4$ is not warped, three extra times are warped together with ordinary space, the Lovelock terms add to
   the junction conditions, and the space is not cut at the brane: Randall and Sundrum identify the two sides of their brane
   (one physical side), while the fold of UM-3 has two distinct sides (example 7).
7. *A particle bound to a thin layer.* A particle held by an attractive thin layer has a wave function that falls off
   exponentially with the distance on both sides, and the layer makes its derivative jump (for the first-order Dirac
   equation, the wave function itself). In UM-3 the particles $\chi$ of dark matter are the states of dirac16complex bound to
   the fold; at rest and without their self-interaction (the field is
   $\Psi = \mathrm{e}^{3H\lvert\sigma\rvert}\chi(\sigma)\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\omega_{\mathrm{b}}x_4}$)

$$
(\mathsf{R}_1\chi)(\sigma) = T_0T_1T_2T_3\,\chi(-\sigma),\qquad (\mathsf{R}_2\chi)(\sigma) = T_0T_5T_6T_7\,\chi(-\sigma) \tag{FD-10}

**Symbols in (FD-10).**

- $\mathsf{R}_1$: The reflection across the fold acting on a profile of dirac16complex together with the reflection of ordinary space, $(\mathsf{R}_1\chi)(\sigma) = T_0T_1T_2T_3\,\chi(-\sigma)$ (FD-10): a symmetry of dirac16complex, of gravity and of the mean field of the gas of the particles $\chi$; the bound states of Krein charge $-1$ are even, those of Krein charge $+1$ odd. Unit: dimensionless. Status: DERIVED.
- $\mathsf{R}_2$: The reflection across the fold acting on a profile of dirac16complex together with the reflection of the extra times, $(\mathsf{R}_2\chi)(\sigma) = T_0T_5T_6T_7\,\chi(-\sigma)$ (FD-10): it maps the bound states of one Krein charge onto those of the other. Unit: dimensionless. Status: DERIVED.
- $\chi(\sigma)$: The profile of a mode of dirac16complex along the hidden direction, $\Psi = \mathrm{e}^{3H\lvert\sigma\rvert}\chi(\sigma)\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}(\vec k\cdot\vec x - \omega x_4)}$ (a 16-component spinor function of $\sigma$); as a four-dimensional field, $\chi$ denotes the particle of a bound state and $\bar\chi$ its antiparticle. Unit: GeV$^{2}$ (with the $V_*$ normalisation). Status: DERIVED.

   ($T_a$ the author's Dirac matrices; for states at rest $\mathsf{R}_1$ is the reflection across the fold combined with the
   reflection of ordinary space, $\mathsf{R}_2$ the reflection across the fold combined with the reflection of the extra
   times). The Krein charge of a state is its share of the conserved charge of dirac16complex, which is indefinite: a
   state can carry the charge $-1$ or $+1$. $\mathsf{R}_1$ is a symmetry of dirac16complex, of gravity and of the mean
   field of a gas of the particles $\chi$ (the average field that the particles of the gas create and feel): the four bound
   states of Krein charge $-1$ (the particles $\chi$) are even under it and the four of Krein charge $+1$ are odd, so the
   mean field of the gas cannot mix the two signs of the indefinite charge. $\mathsf{R}_2$ maps the bound states of one
   Krein charge onto those of the other and makes the two sets degenerate without the self-interaction.
9. *The planes of Horava and Witten.* In M-theory (the eleven-dimensional theory whose limits include the superstring
   theories) on an interval (a circle whose points are identified with their mirror images), the two ten-dimensional planes
   left in place by the reflection are mirror surfaces (property 1); each carries one $E_8$ gauge group while gravity fills
   the bulk. As in UM-3, the gauge fields live on the mirror surface and gravity in the bulk; unlike UM-3, the two sides of
   each plane are identified (one physical side).

**What is not a fold.**

* *The tips* $z = 0$ and $z = \pi$ (mod $\pi$): the mirror exchanges them within a period, but there the warp factor vanishes,
  $g_{x_0x_0}$ diverges, and they lie at an infinite proper distance; they carry no thin source.
* *A smooth maximum of a warp factor*, such as $1/\cosh^2(H\sigma)$: mirror symmetric and largest at $\sigma = 0$, but without a
  kink and without a thin source.

## The new revision UM-3 (2026-10-24): `universe_model_3/`

On 2026-10-24 the author ordered a major new revision and the permanent stop of every earlier stage (W8, old Stages 4 and
5, the follow-ups of UM-2; nothing was running, and every verified result was already on `main`; see `HANDOFF.md`
section 0.14). The revision is in [`universe_model_3/`](universe_model_3/README.md): the author's new notebook `4+4.nb`
(the eight real 16 x 16 Dirac matrices), its provenance `universe_model_3/dirac matrices.md`, the new metric with
b4(x4)^2 (b4 never identically 1), the Higgs doublet, the electroweak gauge fields W1, W2, W3, B, gluons, three
generations of quarks and leptons, and dirac16complex coupled to gravity and, with separate left-handed and
right-handed couplings, to every Standard-Model field, with the complete coupled field equations and a Kohn-Sham
approximate solution. Completed on 2026-10-25: the documents `MODEL`, `FIELD_EQUATIONS`, `SOLUTION`, `ANALYSIS` and
`PROVENANCE` (each as .md, .tex and .pdf, every equation written out and every symbol defined in each of them), with
167 verification checks in 13 modules, all passing. The solution covers the background and the metric as a power
series, the Higgs field in the ad hoc vacuum, the spectra along the hidden direction (the `x0` mass of the bound states),
the self-consistent Kohn-Sham states of dirac16complex, the neutrino flavours (Sun, supernova envelope, fast instability,
equipartition), the thermal history with the portals and direct detection, and the CMB (Planck 2018), BAO (DESI DR2) and
CNB. Extended on 2026-10-25 at the author's orders of 03:21 to 05:09 PDT: the sources of the fold (its thin fluid, the
graviton term that the Lovelock terms give its kink, and the Einstein-Hilbert term that its fields may induce, which the
author's original weights required and GW170817 bounds), the
answers to the open questions (the Krein norm of dirac16complex, fields that depend on the extra times, the speed of the
particles chi, the primordial era, the lightest neutrino mass and the Dirac phase), one definition of the fold with its
examples in every file that uses the word, and the document `STABILISER` (.md, .tex, .pdf) on the stabiliser of the bulk,
the medium that a static late-time bulk required with the author's original weights, found and named by Claude (Anthropic)
on 2026-10-24. Corrected on 2026-10-25 at the author's order of 07:55 PDT ("Gravitons must travel at c ... my choices are
wrong, and you MUST correct them"): the Lovelock weights (1, 1/32, 1/1152) and Lambda = -10 H^2 of the author's notebook are
replaced by (1, 1/20, 1/360) and Lambda = -7 H^2, the only values for which the graviton of the four-dimensional world, on the
fold, travels at the speed of light at linear order while no graviton of the static bulk travels faster (a criterion chosen
because the order cannot be met in full); they are the Born-Infeld gravity of eight dimensions. With them the static block is a vacuum (there is no stabiliser), the fold source is a pure tension, and with frozen
extra times the fold obeys exactly the Friedmann equations of general relativity. What the correction cannot do is stated in
every document: the static bulk has no linear graviton at all (it is strongly coupled, and its response to sources is open),
the bulk of an expanding fold keeps modes without a time-kinetic term (they respond instantaneously), the propagation of the
polarisation along the extra times on an expanding fold is open (generically not luminal), and no choice of the weights and of Lambda gives
gravitons at the speed of light both in the bulk and on the fold, because the time of the author's metric is not warped;
changing the metric is the author's decision. A first version of the correction had claimed luminal gravitons everywhere
(`claude_failures.md`, I8). New modules `um3_weights.py` and `um3_linear.py` (the linearised field equations for every
perturbation of the metric); every document and module revised, `STABILISER` rebuilt as the record of the stabiliser and of its
removal; 223 verification checks in 22 modules, all passing, each run under the 423 s limit. Its README states every part and its checks.

## The universe model UM-2: `universe_model_2/`

On 2026-10-17 the author ordered a new model of the Universe: Einstein-Lovelock gravity with the author's weights and
Lambda, the dirac16complex field (the dark-matter hypothesis) coupled through the canonical spin connection, photons,
neutrinos, electrons, quarks, gluons, W+ (charge +e), W- (charge -e) and Z, no Higgs particle, every mass from the x0
dependence of wave functions with period pi/(6H). On 2026-10-18 he ordered three neutrino flavours with mixing and flavour
conversion; version 2 of the model therefore has three full generations of quarks and leptons (anomaly free generation by
generation), the PMNS and CKM matrices from the x0 mechanism, and the flavour conversion of the neutrinos in vacuum, matter,
the Sun, the early Universe (N_eff), the cosmic neutrino background and supernovae. The model, its provenance, its coupled
field equations, an approximate solution with Kohn-Sham theory for dirac16complex, and the analysis of the x0 mass mechanism
and of the dark-matter and dark-energy associations are in [`universe_model_2/`](universe_model_2/README.md) (documents as
.md, .tex and .pdf; 235 verification checks, all passing). An independent review of version 2
found that the relic abundance of its dark matter (the heavy odd quanta of dirac16complex) cannot be produced by the
gauge-kinetic portal within perturbative unitarity. Version 3 (2026-10-18) adds the s-wave portal I13 (an x0-chiral vector
coupling of dirac16complex to the baryon-number current), with which each of the two dark-matter species leaves Omega h^2 =
0.060 within the unitarity limit, the thermal history with the freeze-in of the fold bands (Delta N_eff = 0.001), the coupled
Kohn-Sham solution in ten environments, and the metric as a power series of terms of decreasing magnitude. An independent
review of version 3 led to the I13 sum over the seven directions other than x0 (where its bilinear is Hermitian), the full
block response to the hot plasma, the order-alpha electroweak condensates and a bound on the self-interaction of dirac16complex.
Version 3 with these fixes was reproduced from a fresh clone of the repository on 2026-10-18 (commit 815db9e, all 235
checks passed, every stored number reproduced, the documents rebuilt byte-identical). Version 4 (2026-10-18) reorganises and
re-presents the model at the author's order: every one of the 841 display equations of the five documents is followed by the
complete list of its symbols (one meaning per symbol, generated from one registry and checked by a script), the 136 field
equations and 18 interaction terms are numbered and written out wherever they are used, and a new computation measures the
residual of the approximate solution in 26 field equations and its consistency across 26 links between them; reproduced from
a fresh clone (commit cec385b, 287 of 287 checks, every number identical, the documents byte-identical).

## The current record: `Revision/`

Since 2026-10-01 the authoritative record of the author's primordial gravitational field is the
separate folder [`Revision/`](Revision/README.md) (binding plan [`Revision/SPEC.md`](Revision/SPEC.md)),
written anew and not mixed with the earlier stages described further below, which are kept unchanged.
It uses the author's metric with the second function b4(x4) (the change of 2026-10-14; b4 is a
function of x4, never 1). In particular, the dark-sector hypotheses of dirac16complex and
dirac16complex00 are investigated there for that metric: the record is
[`Revision/dark_sector/`](Revision/dark_sector/), the provenance of its change to b4(x4) is
[`Revision/dark_sector/B4_PROVENANCE.md`](Revision/dark_sector/B4_PROVENANCE.md), and the document is
[`Revision/docs/DARK_SECTOR_HYPOTHESES.md`](Revision/docs/DARK_SECTOR_HYPOTHESES.md) (neither hypothesis
is established). The textbook "Universes in Pairs" is in [`Revision/textbook/`](Revision/textbook/).
The Stage-3 dark-sector numerics below were computed before the Revision (completed 2026-09-30, on
homogeneous backgrounds without b4, with static extra times in two of the five experiments) and are
superseded by that record.

**Work in progress (2026-10-16): everything in `Revision/` moves to b4(x4).** The order of 2026-10-15 ("move
everything to b4(x4); b4 is never 1") is carried out in nine phases ([`HANDOFF.md`](HANDOFF.md), section 0.9;
the rule is in [`Revision/SPEC.md`](Revision/SPEC.md), section 1: exact results for general b4(x4), numerical
work on the history a4 = H x4, b4 = b4(0) e^{(4/3) H x4}, a prescribed background). Done and pushed: phase 1
(`Revision/theory/`: Wolfram 84/84, sympy 72/72, scope 15/15 and 14/14, all for general a4 and b4), phases 2
and 3 (`Revision/field_equations_a4/`: Wolfram 59/59, sympy 65/65; `Revision/lead_checks/`: 10/10, 14/14,
12/12). In progress: phase 4, the Kohn-Sham record (`Revision/kohn_sham/`). Still open: phases 5 to 9 (the
Kohn-Sham source, pairing, the Revision notebooks, the documents and the textbook). Until they are done, the
records of those folders still describe b4 = 1, the gate steps a4-ks-source and a4-ks-source-unittest stop, and
the publication tests of three Revision documents fail (they quote the b4 = 1 check names); the dark sector
(`Revision/dark_sector/`) was already computed with b4(x4) on 2026-10-15.

Everything is counted from 0: coordinates `x = {x0,...,x7}`, frame indices
`a = 0..7`, spinor components `Psi_0..Psi_15`.  The tangent metric is
`eta = diag(+1,+1,+1,+1,-1,-1,-1,-1)` and `x4` is the evolution time.

## The object

`dirac16complex` is a section `Psi` of the complexified rank-16 spinor bundle
`S_C = P_Spin(M) x_rho (C (x) (Delta_- (+) Delta_+))` whose components are complex,
anticommuting (Grassmann-odd) fields.  Under Pin(4,4) (double cover of O(4,4))
`C^16` is irreducible; under Spin(4,4) (double cover of SO(4,4), the determinant-1
transformations) it is the direct sum of two inequivalent irreducible
8-dimensional representations.  Both statements are proved by exact commutant and
intertwiner computations.

The gamma matrices are the author's eight REAL 16 x 16 Dirac matrices `T16^A[0..7]`,
taken by evaluating the author's own notebook cells.  `provenance/dirac matrices.md`
proves that they are real and satisfy `{T16^A[a], T16^A[b]} = 2 eta_ab I16`.  It proves
that the scaled commutators `(1/4)[T16^A[a], T16^A[b]]` span spin(4,4) and generate
Spin_0(4,4); together with `T16^A[0]` and `T16^A[4]` they generate Pin(4,4).  It
displays the matrices, their products and the projectors `P_L`, `P_R`, and checks that
every gamma source in the repository equals them.

Its Lagrangian density, loosely based on the notebook's `Lg[]`, is

    L = sqrt|g| [ (1/2)(Psibar gamma^mu D_mu Psi - (D_mu Psibar) gamma^mu Psi)
                  - m Psibar Psi - U(Psibar Psi) ],        Psibar = Psi^dagger sigma16,

with the canonical (Levi-Civita) spin connection
`D_mu = d_mu + (1/8) omega_{mu ab} [gamma^a, gamma^b]` fixed by the vielbein
postulate (the total covariant derivative of the vielbein vanishes).  Its
Euler–Lagrange equation is `gamma^mu D_mu Psi = (m + U'(Psibar Psi)) Psi`.

Three findings about the notebook's `Lg[]` motivated this construction (each is
proved exactly, in Wolfram Language and independently in Python):

1. `sigma16` is symmetric and `sigma16 . T16^A` antisymmetric (the task's
   expression [1]); for an anticommuting real `Psi16` the mass term vanishes and the
   kinetic term is a total divergence, so `Lg[]` has empty Euler–Lagrange
   equations (0 = 0).  A complex field with the Dirac adjoint is required.
2. `Lg[]` contracts the mixed `omega_mu^a_b` with `SAB[[a,b]] = S^{ab}`: one metric
   factor is missing.  With that contraction the gamma matrices are not covariantly
   constant; with `omega_{mu ab} = eta_ac omega_mu^c_b` they are.
3. In the notebook's cell 1058 the rule
   `1/Sqrt[Sin[6Hx0]^(1/3)/E^(2a4)] -> 1/(E^a4 Sin[6Hx0]^(1/6))` is wrong (the correct
   right-hand side is `E^a4/Sin[6Hx0]^(1/6)`); a reconstruction with it reproduces
   the stored cell-1137 equations exactly, including a spurious term
   `q = Q1 Sinh[a4] a4' E^-a4`.  The correct equations differ from cell 1137 only by
   that term.

Status at this push (2026-09-30; HANDOFF.md section 2 is the authoritative,
per-stage list):

- **Stages 1 and 2 are complete.** Their exact verifiers, documents and reviews are
  done, and both gate twins of each stage pass from fresh public clones.  The Stage 1
  gate needs nothing private: without the git-ignored reference folder `dirac-main/`
  it runs in a public-clone mode that regenerates every file into `build/stage1/`,
  requires the regenerated files to equal the committed ones except for the
  dirac-main cross-checks, which it reports as skipped; with `dirac-main/` it also
  reproduces those cross-checks.
- **Stage 3 is complete.** The engine, the five experiments and their checkers,
  both notebooks, the figures and both documents are committed; the 21 problems of
  the second review round are fixed; both gate twins `scripts/verify_stage3_dark_sector.{sh,ps1}`
  passed from fresh public clones (all 32 steps, 323 unit tests).
- **Stage 4 is not finished.** The exact Kohn–Sham theory (Wolfram 125/125, sympy
  157/157) and the Rust Kohn–Sham solver `studies/dirac16complex_kohn_sham` are
  complete and reproducible.  The independent Python reference agrees on 65 of 69
  cross-checks; 4 disagreements remain (`handoff/reviews/stage4_crosscheck_quick_2026-09-30.log`).
  The Stage-4 notebooks, documents, review and gate do not exist yet.
- **Stage 4 is paused** at the user's request (2026-09-30).
- **Stage 5 is in progress** (specification `handoff/specs/STAGE5_SPEC.md`): the
  classical commuting 16-component Pin(4,4) spinor field dirac16complex00, the
  Lagrangians of both fields with explicit mass terms, their energy-momentum tensors
  and equations of state in an arbitrary and in the primordial field, the Kohn–Sham
  ground and first excited states of both fields, and exact theorems on pairs of
  universes of masses +M and −M.

## Reproducing

Windows 11 (PowerShell), from the repository root:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup_solver.ps1 -Platform win11
.\scripts\verify_stage1_arbitrary_field.ps1
.\scripts\verify_stage2_primordial_field.ps1
.\scripts\verify_stage3_dark_sector.ps1
.\scripts\verify_stage4_kohn_sham.ps1
```

Git Bash, macOS or Linux:

```bash
bash scripts/setup_solver.sh win11
bash scripts/verify_stage1_arbitrary_field.sh
bash scripts/verify_stage2_primordial_field.sh
bash scripts/verify_stage3_dark_sector.sh
bash scripts/verify_stage4_kohn_sham.sh
```

Each gate ends with the line `stageN_..._verification=OK`.  The Stage 3 gate
reruns all five experiments twice and executes both notebooks (tens of minutes).
The Stage 4 gate reproduces the Rust Kohn–Sham outputs byte for byte, which takes
hours; its header lists the wall time of every step.

`setup_solver` clones the pinned pure-Rust SUNDIALS 7.8.0 engine from
`once-ere/rustSolveIt_{Win11,macos-silicon,linux}_SUNDIALS_7_8_0` into the
git-ignored `vendor/rustSolveIt`.  The committed numerical outputs were produced
with the Win11 engine (commit `a8fdff45`), which reproduces them byte for byte on
Windows and Linux; the macOS/Linux engines carry a different mathematical library,
so their results agree to solver tolerance rather than byte for byte.  WolframScript (Wolfram Engine or Mathematica),
Python 3 with numpy and sympy, and a TeX distribution are needed for the exact
verifiers and the PDFs; the student guide lists every step.

## Scientific boundary

The (4,4) signature is not observed spacetime.  Canonical quantization in x4 gives
an indefinite-metric (Krein) state space; a positive Fock space exists in the sector
independent of the three extra times, while modes depending on them are unstable.
The cosmological computations are homogeneous backgrounds (mean field and mode
sums); perturbation stability and data likelihoods are not studied, and no
observational detection is claimed.  The Kohn–Sham computations of Stage 4 are
static mean-field states of a finite number of quanta in the fixed primordial
field (no back-reaction on the metric), with the exact Hartree–Fock exchange of
the contact interaction and no correlation term.
